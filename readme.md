# CSS Practise

Hi! My name is Oliver and I'm awful at anything front end-related. I'm a professional backend developer working primarily with C++, Python and C#, and I thought it'd be nice to develop some skills for the visual side of things.

To do this, I've created this repository, where I try to make small CSS projects to get some practise in. Until now, I've been trying to copy the look and feel of sites I come across by programming the HTML and CSS by hand.

I've published the repo as [github pages](https://olivervea.github.io/css-practise/), so feel free to have a look!

## Projects

1. The first project, [01](./01), was trying to replicate the [node.js documentation page](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/). The result can be seen in [github pages](https://olivervea.github.io/css-practise/01/).
